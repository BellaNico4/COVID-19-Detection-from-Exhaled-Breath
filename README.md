# COVID-19-Detection-from-Exhaled-Breath

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the models for COVID-19 prediction described in the paper "COVID-19 Detection from Exhaled Breath" by Nicolò Bellarmino, Riccardo Cantoro, Michele Castelluzzo, Raffaele Correale, Giovanni Squillero, Giorgio Bozzini, Francesco Castelletti, Carla Ciricugno, Daniela Dalla Gasperina, Francesco Dentali, Giovanni Poggialini, Piergiorgio Salerno & Stefano Taborelli. Published in 2024 in the *Scientific Reports*. 

Our framework leverages breath fingerprints analysis to detect COVID-19 without explicit VOC identification. The approach is fast and straightforward to be implemented.
