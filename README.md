# COVID-19-Detection-from-Exhaled-Breath

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the models for COVID-19 prediction described in the paper "[COVID-19 Detection from Exhaled Breath(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620213](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-74104-1?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20241006&utm_content=10.1038/s41598-024-74104-1)" by Nicolò Bellarmino, Riccardo Cantoro, Michele Castelluzzo, Raffaele Correale, Giovanni Squillero, Giorgio Bozzini, Francesco Castelletti, Carla Ciricugno, Daniela Dalla Gasperina, Francesco Dentali, Giovanni Poggialini, Piergiorgio Salerno & Stefano Taborelli. Published in 2024 in the *Scientific Reports*. 

Our framework leverages breath fingerprints analysis to detect COVID-19 without explicit VOC identification. The approach is fast and straightforward to be implemented.
